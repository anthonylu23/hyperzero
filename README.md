# HyperZero

AlphaZero-style self-play for N-dimensional Connect-K.

HyperZero is a reinforcement learning research project focused on a configurable family of abstract strategy games: Connect-K played on N-dimensional boards. The project starts with a rigorous game engine and baseline agents, then builds toward neural-guided Monte Carlo Tree Search, self-play training, and experiments on how dimensionality affects learning and search.

## Core Goal

Build a general N-dimensional Connect-K platform and use it to study whether AlphaZero-style agents can learn strong play as the game scales from 2D to 3D and 4D.

The first serious target is:

> Train an AlphaZero-style agent that beats pure MCTS and heuristic baselines on 3D 4x4x4 Connect-4.

The stretch target is:

> Extend the same system to 4D 4x4x4x4 Connect-4 and analyze what breaks.
